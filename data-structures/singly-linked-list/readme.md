### Description:

A `SinglyLinkedList` is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of elements (nodes) connected through pointers. Each node contains two parts: data and a reference (pointer) to the next node in the sequence. The first node in the list is called the head, and the last node's reference is typically set to null. This structure allows for efficient insertion and removal of elements, making it suitable for scenarios where dynamic resizing and flexible data management are required.

### Complexity:

- Accessing an element by index (e.g., `find()`): O(n) - Linear time complexity. To access a specific element by its value, the singly linked list may need to be traversed from the head until the desired element is found.

- Insertion (e.g., `insert()`): O(1) - Constant time complexity. Inserting an element after a given node requires updating only a few pointers, making the operation very efficient.

- Deletion (e.g., `remove()`): O(n) - Linear time complexity. Removing an element from the singly linked list may involve traversing the list to find the node that precedes the one to be removed.

- Displaying the elements (e.g., `display()`): O(n) - Linear time complexity. To display the entire singly linked list, the code iterates through each element, resulting in a linear time operation.

### Methods:

1. `constructor()`: The constructor method creates a new instance of the `SinglyLinkedList` and initializes it with a head node, acting as a sentinel node.

2. `find(data)`: This method searches for a node with the specified `data` and returns the node if found. It traverses the singly linked list starting from the head node.

3. `insert(newData, afterData)`: This method inserts a new node with `newData` after the node with `afterData`. It updates the pointers of the nodes to include the new node in the list.

4. `display()`: This method displays the elements (data) of the singly linked list in order. It starts from the head node and iterates through each node until the end of the list is reached.

5. `findPrevious(data)`: This method finds the node that precedes the node with the specified `data`. It is used in the `remove()` method to remove a node from the list.

6. `remove(data)`: This method removes the first occurrence of a node with the specified `data` from the singly linked list. It uses the `findPrevious()` method to identify the node to be removed and updates the pointers to remove the node from the list.

These methods provide basic functionality for managing elements in the singly linked list, such as inserting, finding, and removing nodes. Depending on specific use cases, additional methods can be added to the `SinglyLinkedList` class to enhance its capabilities, like finding the last element, checking if the list is empty, etc.

### Features:

- The `SinglyLinkedList` class is implemented using a singly linked list, where each node only points to the next node in the sequence.

- The class provides methods for inserting, finding, and removing elements from the singly linked list.

- It also includes a `display()` method to visualize the elements in the singly linked list.

- The head node serves as a sentinel node (also known as a dummy node) that simplifies certain list operations and ensures that the singly linked list is never empty.

- The implementation allows for duplicate elements in the singly linked list.

- The `SinglyLinkedList` is dynamic in size, and elements can be added or removed without any fixed size limit.

- The data structure is well-suited for scenarios where frequent insertion and deletion operations are required and when the size of the singly linked list is not known beforehand.

- Note that this particular implementation is a singly linked list. There are other variations, such as doubly linked lists, where each node has references to both the previous and next nodes.

- The `SinglyLinkedList` class is extensible, and you can add more methods to suit specific use cases, such as finding the last element, checking for an empty list, etc.
